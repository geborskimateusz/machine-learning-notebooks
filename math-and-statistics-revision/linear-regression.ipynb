    "Linear regression is a basic predictive analytics technique that uses historical data to predict an output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that if we can fit a linear regression model to observed data, we can then use the model to predict any future values. For example, let’s assume that we have found from historical data that the price (P) of a house is linearly dependent upon its size (S) — in fact, we found that a house’s price is exactly 90 times its size. The equation will look like this:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>P = 90 x S</b>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "With this model, we can then predict the cost of any house. If we have a house that is 1,500 square feet, we can calculate its price to be:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<b>P = 90 x 1500 = $135,000</b>\n"
